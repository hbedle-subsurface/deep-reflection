/* ============================ glossary ============================
   Terms marked in the text open a small card giving what the term means and
   what the quantity is used for. The two are kept apart on purpose: what a
   thing measures is arithmetic, what it is used for is a separate claim.

   Marking is automatic. glossaryScan walks the text of a page and marks the
   first occurrence of each term it finds, once per page, so the prose is not
   littered with the same word marked eight times. A page can also mark a term
   by hand with <button class="gterm" data-g="slug">…</button>.

   Entries: what  — the definition
            use   — what the quantity is used for, where that differs
            see   — related slugs, shown as links inside the card
            alt   — other spellings that should also be marked */

"semblance": {term:"semblance",
  what:"A normalized measure of how alike neighboring traces are over a short time window, from 0 to 1.",

  see:["two-way-time","velocity"], alt:["vertical exaggeration"]},

"clipping": {term:"clipping",
  what:"Setting the ends of the color scale at a percentile of the data rather than at its extremes, so that a few large samples do not compress everything else into the middle of the scale.",

  see:["crustal-reflectivity","cocorp"], alt:["Mohorovicic"]},

"crustal-reflectivity": {term:"crustal reflectivity",
  what:"The banded, laterally discontinuous reflections typical of the lower continental crust.",
